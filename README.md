# cmse322-backend

This is a README file for installing and running a DocFinder university app. The app is built using Node.js and Express framework. The following instructions will guide you through the installation process.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
- 
Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
```
- Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
Copy code
cd <project-directory>
```
- Install the dependencies using either NPM or Yarn:

```shell
Copy code
# Using NPM
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn install
```

Configuration
The app may require some configuration before running. Here are the common configuration steps:

- Rename the .env.example file to .env.
- Open the .env file and modify the configuration values as needed. This file typically contains environment-specific settings such as database connection details, API keys, and other configuration options.
- Make sure to provide valid and appropriate values for your environment.

Running the App
Once the installation and configuration steps are completed, you can start the Express app using the following command:

```
shell
Copy code
# Using NPM
npm start

# Using Yarn
yarn start
```

The app will start running on the specified port (default is usually 3000). You should see a message in the console indicating that the server has started successfully.

Testing
To run the tests for the app, you can use the following command:

```
shell
Copy code
# Using NPM
npm test

# Using Yarn
yarn test
```
This command will execute the test suite and display the test results in the console.

API Documentation
If the app includes an API, you can find the documentation for the available endpoints and request/response formats in the project's documentation directory or by referring to the API documentation provided separately.
